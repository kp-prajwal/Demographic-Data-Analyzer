# Demographic Data Analyzer
*freeCodeCamp Demographic Data Analyzer Project* 

# The Project
In this project, I wrote a function that would analyze demographic data using Pandas. I was given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database. I parsed through the data in order to address the questions provided by freeCodeCamp.

# Questions
The goal here is to create a function that answers the following questions using Pandas:

 * How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column)
 * What is the average age of men?
 * What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
 * What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
 * What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
 * What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
 * What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
 * What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
 * Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.

# The Process
The questions I need to answer were given to me, so the process was much easier this time around. https://github.com/kulkarniprajwal/Demographic-Data-Analyzer/blob/master/demographic.ipynb

Once the questions were all answered I put the code all under one function. 
# The Conclusion 
While working on this challenge I was able to practice reading a csv file into a dataframe using pandas, as well as parse through the dataframe to locate needed information using pandas.
