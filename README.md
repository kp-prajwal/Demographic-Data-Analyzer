# DemographicDataAnalyzer
*Free code Camp Demographic Data Analyzer Project* 

# The Project
In this project, I had to write a function that would analyze demographic data. The data consisted of Census data obtained in 1994. I would parse through the data in order to address the questions provided by free code camp. 

To see the instructions please follow the link: **https://repl.it/@freeCodeCamp/fcc-demographic-data-analyzer**

# The Process
The questions I need to answer were given to me, so the process was much easier this time around. https://github.com/kulkarniprajwal/Demographic-Data-Analyzer/blob/master/demographic.ipynb

Once the questions were all answered I put the code all under one function. 
# The Conclusion 
While working on this challenge I was able to practice reading a csv file into a dataframe using pandas, as well as parse through the dataframe to locate needed information using pandas.
